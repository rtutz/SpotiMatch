## Future Work
---

SpotiMatch is an evolving project with exciting potential for further improvements and enhancements. Here are some key areas we're looking to explore in the future:

1. **Mobile Friendliness**: We recognize the increasing use of mobile devices for music consumption and interaction. Enhancing SpotiMatch's mobile responsiveness and creating dedicated mobile apps will be a priority, ensuring a seamless experience for users on various devices.

2. **Machine Learning for Music Taste Compatibility**: To provide even more accurate and personalized music compatibility insights, we aim to incorporate machine learning algorithms. These algorithms will analyze user preferences and behavior to calculate music taste compatibility more intelligently and meaningfully.

3. **Account Limitations**: While we currently face limitations with the Spotify API only allowing a set number of Spotify accounts to be used within the app, we plan to explore potential workarounds or solutions. This will ensure that SpotiMatch can accommodate a broader user base and provide its unique features to as many Spotify users as possible.
